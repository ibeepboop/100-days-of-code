# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 11, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Worked through GitHub Basics Tutorial by Tiffany Thompson (via FreeCodeCamp) on YouTube

**Thoughts:**: I have been terrified of the command line, Git, and GitHub for far too long. Today I decided to just tackle that fear and dive in. Spoiler: it wasn't that bad! Haha. I don't feel terrified that I'm going to accidentally write over someone else's master branch and ruin their life (my brain sometimes has a tendency to spiral, whoops). I am certainly not a master of Git at this point, but I know enough to be (less?) dangerous. I actually feel quite empowered now that I have a basic understanding of how to use Git and manipulate local repositories as well as my remote repository on GitHub. I also feel for some reason that I won't be as intimidated to pursue other areas of tech knowledge that I have previously been afraid of for one reason or another because I have tackled this one fear. Imposter Syndrome is a real thing, y'all. BUT YOU CAN SHOW IT WHO'S BOSS *flex*

### Day 1: February 12, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Worked through Git & GitHub Crash Course for Beginners by Traversy Media on YouTube; forked/cloned the 100-days-of-code repo from GitHub to begin work! Made a schedule for my 100DoC journey to help me keep on track, because planning is half the battle, IMO.

**Thoughts:**: Today I felt comfortable enough to go ahead and fork/clone the official 100-days-of-code repo so that I can go ahead and start tracking my progress through 100DoC. I know it may seem silly, but this really is a BIG step for me. I've started and stopped 100DoC 3 or 4 times since November. Some of that was due to holidays/family stuff, but a lot if it was because I just felt overwhelmed and kind of scared. Even when I was coding, I wasn't actually tracking any of my progress except for the occasional Tweet. This feels like a major, firm step in the right direction. I'm excited to start making commits to my own little corner of 100DoC :)

### Day 2: February 13, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Completed the Intro to Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum, then worked on the Tribute Page for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certificate. Decided to go with a tribute to Kevin's Famous Chili from The Office. Created all of the files using Git Bash and Git commands, which made me feel super cool. Made the README.md file for that, and did most of the HTML for the webpage. 
**Thoughts**: I had a lot of fun working on stuff today. "Casual Friday" is one of my favorite episodes of The Office specifically for the opening "Kevin's Chili" scene. It's a lot of fun to work on projects that I am genuinely interested in; I think that's the key to making the learning process fun. Plus, I think my Tribute Page is going to be HILARIOUS when it's done. Also, an unexpected amount of learning has come from doing the README file. I didn't know that Markdown was a sort of language on its own, and I can see how learning to format READMEs appropriately will be super helpful in the future. I actually think fCC, bootcamps, etc. should devote a little bit of time to proper README formatting/documentation. It doesn't seem like they really do.

 Full disclosure: I have done the freeCodeCamp HTML curriculum before, but I thought it would be a good idea to just restart it so that it was fresh in my head while I worked on the Tribute Page. It didn't take that long, so I think it was a good use of time.
