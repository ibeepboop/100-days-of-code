## Log

### R1D1
Started learning Git/GitHub via FreeCodeCamp YouTube tutorial by Tiffany Thompson.

### R1D2
Learned Git/GitHub via Traversy Media tutorial on GitHub. Forked/cloned 100-days-of-code repo! Made official 100DoC personal schedule! Party time!

### R1D3
Completed Intro to Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum on fCC. Worked on Tribute Page for the fCC Responsive Web Design Certification (worked on HTML file and made the README.md file for the GitHub repository).

### R1D4
Completed the first module of Codecademy's Intro to HTML course. Added a link to my fCC Tribute Page's html file. Listened to S5E13 of the Learn to Code with Me podcast ("7 Emerging Technologies to Learn in 2019"). Did some research into Flatiron School, Skillcrush, Lambda School. Also looked into CompTIA certifications as a possible way to get my foot in the door for a first job.
