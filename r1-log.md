The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on February 12, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1
Started learning Git/GitHub via FreeCodeCamp YouTube tutorial by Tiffany Thompson.

### R1D2
Learned Git/GitHub via Traversy Media tutorial on GitHub. Forked/cloned 100-days-of-code repo! Made official 100DoC personal schedule! Party time!

### R1D3
Completed Intro to Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum on fCC. Worked on Tribute Page for the fCC Responsive Web Design Certification (worked on HTML file and made the README.md file for the GitHub repository).

### R1D4
Completed the first module of Codecademy's Intro to HTML course. Added a link to my fCC Tribute Page's html file. Listened to S5E13 of the Learn to Code with Me podcast ("7 Emerging Technologies to Learn in 2019"). Did some research into Flatiron School, Skillcrush, Lambda School. Also looked into CompTIA certifications as a possible way to get my foot in the door for a first job.

### R1D5
Worked through Codecademy tutorial to make an interactive story using Twine. Indirectly learned about the Electron js framework, React, how to contribute to an open source project as a beginner on GitHub, and minifying/unminifying code. Worked through the Codecademy Intro to HTML curriculum; made a "fashion blog", HTML only. Also made a wine festival schedule to practice making HTML tables, but will need to revise the CSS file that accompanies the HTML file.

### R1D6
Completed all of the Codecademy Intro to HTML curriculum. Made a "Mad Lib"-type story using HTML forms/inputs as the freeform project for the Codecademy course. Also started watching Professor Messer's CompTIA training videos on YouTube. Seriously considering getting my A+ certification. Need a bit more research though.

### R1D7
No actual coding, but got a schedule together for next week's proceedings. Also got a Pluralsight membership and started watching the CompTIA A+ series of videos. Excited to keep exploring Pluralsight's offerings!

### R1D8 & 9
Worked through Sections 6 & 7 of Brad Hussey's Udemy Course "The Ultimate Web Designer and Developer Course." Made a basic webpage (Mac from "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's 'personal' website; it's pretty funny). Mostly wanted to work through this course and see if there was any more HTML I could learn from him that I hadn't already learned. Most of it was review, but I did get in some more practice making HTML forms.
